# 🎧 HEADPHONES Landing Page

Welcome to the **HEADPHONES** landing page project — a sleek, responsive web interface designed to showcase audio excellence with modern aesthetics and intuitive interactions.

This project is part of the `alx_html_css` repository and lives in the `headphones` directory.

---

## 📐 Design Source

The layout and visual assets are based on a Figma design file (duplicate it to your Drafts for full access).  
Make sure to install the required fonts locally:

- **Source Sans Pro**
- **Spin Cycle OT**

Some measurements in the design may be in float values — rounding is acceptable for implementation.

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

The page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:

- Mobile version activates at screen width ≤ **480px**
- Max content width: **1000px**, centered horizontally
- Navigation collapses gracefully on smaller screens

---

## 🎨 Interactions & Styling

- **Links (hover/active):** `#FF6565`
- **Buttons (hover/active):** `opacity: 0.9`
- **Typography:** Clean, modern, and accessible
- **Color scheme:** Dark/light contrast with red accents for emphasis
