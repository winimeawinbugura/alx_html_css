## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to recreate the exact design from Figma by applying advanced CSS techniques, including:

- Layout positioning  
- Flexbox  
- Grid  
- Spacing and alignment  
- Typography  
- Colors, backgrounds, and icons  
- Hover states  
- Responsive structure (optional but recommended)

You will write all CSS in the external stylesheet and adjust the HTML structure where necessary (such as adding images, logos, and icons).
